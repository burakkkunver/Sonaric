## Overview
Mina Protocol is a minimal ‚Äúsuccinct blockchain‚Äù built to curtail computational requirements in order to run DApps more efficiently.   
Mina has been described as the world‚Äôs lightest blockchain since its size is designed to remain constant despite growth in usage.   
Furthermore, it remains balanced in terms of security and decentralization.

## System Requirements
- 8 core processor with BMI2 and AVX CPU instruction set
- 32 GB RAM
- 64 GB disk space
- 1 Mbps Internet Connection

More details can be found [here](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/node-operators/requirements)

## Getting Started

### Load Templates

```bash
cd mina
sonaric load MANIFEST
```

Output:
```bash
Loaded 2 runnables, 0 process groups, 0 services, 0 entities and 0 entity instances
‚ú® Loaded:
 ‚îî‚îÄüî© Runnables: 
    ‚îú‚îÄüß© mina/devnet
    ‚îî‚îÄüß© mina/mainnet
‚úî All templates loaded successfully
```

**Confirm templates are loaded:**
```bash
foo@bar:~$ sonaric list mina
```
```
‚úî Got the list

local       mina/devnet   1.0.1    runnable  blockchain  
local       mina/mainnet  1.0.1    runnable  blockchain  
```

### Configuration

The base image currently used for Mina is `mina-daemon`.   
Currently, the following versions are available:
- `3.0.0-93e0279-bullseye-mainnet` for mainnet
- `3.0.0-dc6bf78-focal-devnet` for devnet

Template variables can be set to customize the node's behavior. The following variables can be configured:

| Name                   | Type   | Description                                                   | Default Value                                                                                                                            |

### Run mina daemon

You need to set your `private-key-password` variable in runnable template.
Sonaric will generate a new private key before mina daemon start.

Also, you need to set `libp2p-password` variable in a template.
Sonaric will generate a new libp2p key before mina daemon start.

The keys will be generated only on the first run.

We will use `local/mina/mainnet` template in this example.  
Development network is also available as `local/mina/devnet`.

```bash
sonaric run local/mina/mainnet
```
Output:
```bash

#### Access GraphQL API

After few minutes graphql endpoint will be available at http://34.88.82.185:3085/graphql
(Replace with your IP from the output)

[GraphQL API](https://docs.minaprotocol.com/node-developers/graphql-api)

## Mina Template Actions

Some actions might not work immediately after the node start. 
Mina daemon needs some time to start API services.


### Get libp2p peer id

```bash
sonaric do templates/local/mina/mainnet/get-peer-id

### List keys
Prints Mina daemon keys.  
We're generating and importing new keypair on first run if none exists.
```bash
sonaric do templates/local/mina/mainnet/list-keys
```

Example output:
```bash
‚úî Running action: 
Warning: Could not connect to a running daemon.
Listing from local directory /root/.mina-config
Account .1:
  Public key: B62qkR9p3vKuWKZaxhmtQNSansrsEQAMcDWQ7XcNk1a8Rr9n7HhhdeT
‚ú® Took: 1s
```


### Export keys
Prints both public and private keys.  
Requires `pubkey` as input.  
It's possible to see public keys with `list-keys` [action](#list-keys).   

```bash
sonaric do templates/local/mina/mainnet/export-key pubkey=B62qmJh5sJB4jcrFzCbKK9j8ayp1U2toiEQANLaGeW7a4mq4SpUrozr
```
Example output:
```bash
‚úî Running action: 
Account exported successfully.
Private key:
{"box_primitive":"xsalsa20poly1305","pw_primitive":"argon2i","nonce":"7NjR6gENJ4PvFUJZPaodomKXzePNQZ2LGWr8P6v","pwsalt":"AgAyjqJvEZZ22UpWq4YEd9YanM74","pwdiff":[134217728,6],"ciphertext":"CCzoQjxVMG9ia1B4SU8xEjQJyJ3nZHvNhdUTeLbfAYKboNkRXWBZisKkrQLYeHZZMg3XtvXQf"}
Public key:
B62qmJh5sJB4jcrFzCbKK9j8ayp1U2toiEQANLaGeW7a4mq4SpUrozr
‚ú® Took: 2s
```

### Import key
Imports a private key.  
Requires `privkey` as input. (JSON format)  
```bash
sonaric do templates/local/mina/mainnet/import-key privkey='{"box_primitive":"xsalsa20poly1305","pw_primitive":"argon2i","nonce":"8dEbSrQLicNgPMtw1aruCaZrXgcbt3MEYpvk5vt","pwsalt":"98sNnePSNVkSbZJSG8x42jPUAQa8","pwdiff":[134217728,6],"ciphertext":"BsdaWJv96W5DpDHbkfLqwjMDjLusWQZtPH4e8s4De2CY5D23xdgAM7HXjwj2Sq33BSJLEAC4i"}'
```
Example output:
```bash
‚úî Running action:
üòÑ Imported account!
Public key: B62qkUyePK48iNndRnKqzrwy4RDn4buYdh3HfrL6RWSTRaF5B3FNW3C
‚ú® Took: 2s
```

Confirm the key is imported:
```bash
sonaric do templates/local/mina/mainnet/list-keys
```
```bash
Account .1:
Public key: B62qkUyePK48iNndRnKqzrwy4RDn4buYdh3HfrL6RWSTRaF5B3FNW3C
Balance: 0
Locked: false
Account .2:
Public key: B62qkUyePK48iNndRnKqzrwy4RDn4buYdh3HfrL6RWSTRaF5B3FNW3C
Balance: 0
Locked: true
```

### Get balance
Requires `pubkey` as input.  
```bash
sonaric do templates/local/mina/mainnet/get-balance pubkey=B62qkUyePK48iNndRnKqzrwy4RDn4buYdh3HfrL6RWSTRaF5B3FNW3C
```

Example output:
```bash
‚úî Running action:
There are no funds in this account
‚ú® Took: 1s
```

### Get address
Returns address (mina public key) in json format.
```bash
sonaric do templates/local/mina/mainnet/get-address
```

Example output:
```bash
‚úî Running action:
{"address":"B62qkUyePK48iNndRnKqzrwy4RDn4buYdh3HfrL6RWSTRaF5B3FNW3C"}
‚ú® Took: 1s
```

If you see warning like this before output:
```bash
Warning: Could not connect to a running daemon.
Listing from local directory /root/.mina-config
{"address":"B62qkUyePK48iNndRnKqzrwy4RDn4buYdh3HfrL6RWSTRaF5B3FNW3C"}
```
just wait a few minutes and try again.  
That means the daemon is not ready yet. And that is normal behavior.

### Get balance
Requires `pubkey` as input.  
```bash
sonaric do templates/local/mina/mainnet/get-balance pubkey=B62qkUyePK48iNndRnKqzrwy4RDn4buYdh3HfrL6RWSTRaF5B3FNW3C
```

Example output:
```bash
‚úî Running action:
{"amount": 299}
‚ú® Took: 1s
```
